## Project name 
Flight System Maintenance Project
## Description
This project is about course assignment task 2 (D3 Individual Project) for Software Maintenance course. The idea in this project was to act as maintenance person with unfamiliar code so the source code for Flight system was given by course faculty.
The part I did was to add some unit tests and integration tests for each method in each class. Additionally, task required to add some new feature in the project and implement regression testing based on it. I decided to add possibility for Admin 
to add custom time limits for within the imaginery user would need to do the booking. If custom time is not set, it is by default 5 hours before the flight departure. The design choices of the project are more described in the report document and 
short demonstration video.
## How to run the project
This project is runnable but the main focus was in the test cases and new feature. Thus, this is not meant to be used actually.
## Learning goals with this project
Practice software maintenance tasks and writing different use cases
Practice regression testing for new feature
## Project status
This meets the requirements of the assignment as far as I know and this was just practice assignment so it is unlikely that I will continue the project after this course.
